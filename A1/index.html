            The first thing I paid attention to was the underlined headings. I

          <p>
            I spent the most time dragging around the cupcakes and decor hidden
            on the left side of the home page

            the experience?
          </h2>
          <p>
            My most common interaction on the website was clicking around to see
            if any other surprises were hidden
          </p>

          </h2>
          <p>
            My impression of the interactive experience’s intended goal was to
            surprise me with hidden elements and make me check if there are
            other interactions in the website.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="div6">
          <h2 id="q6">
            How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The website design was very low-key; it was black and white and
            lacked any interesting interaction at a surface level. To hint at a
            surprise interaction, the website laid clues in the articles the
            designer chose to display. Once the user puts the pieces together
            and finds out the hidden secret, they would be rewarded with a
            surprise interaction.

            with over time?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I believe that the cupcakes and decor is the surprise that the user
            gets after interacting with the website for a while. The user would
            first skim through all of the website’s pages and click on the text
            and images. After taking a closer look, the user would realize that
            there are cupcakes hidden behind doors disguised as grids. After
            finding the surprise, the user would go through everything a second
            time to check if they had missed anything.

            How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be

          </h2>
          <p>
            The interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted
            with by presenting itself as very low-key, laying out clues that
            hint at something more special. After the special interaction is
            found, the user would want to go through the website a second time
            to see if they have missed anything.

            What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
            reference?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The experience references other projects, brands, experiences, and
            their website’s personal interactivity.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The references communicate to me that there is more than meets the
            eye, and hint at me to pay more attention to the details.
          </p>

          </h2>
          <p>
            I believe that the reference is communicating to me that I should be
            more humble, as my initial impression of this website was that the
            designer made something uninspiring and amateurish. After I realized
            I missed something about the website, I felt a little foolish.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The most frustrating part about the interaction are the links that
            take you to another tab. There are links that take you to different
            areas of the website, and others that take you to a different
            website. Both of these links look the same, and I find it annoying
            when I am unknowingly taken to another tab.

          </h2>
          <p>
            I find the most satisfying part of the interaction to be finding the
            cupcakes and realizing the references in the website were hinting at
            something hidden the whole time. It feels like watching the movie
            for a second time and finding all the hidden details.
