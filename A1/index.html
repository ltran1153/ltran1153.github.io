          <p>
            The first thing I paid attention to was the underlined headings. I
            believed that pressing them would link me to a different part of the
            website

            <li>I highlighted the texts as I down each page of the website</li>
            <li>I clicked the table next to the main content, which turned out to be doors</li>
            <li>I found out that I could click and drag the cakes around</li>
            <li>I found out the cakes and decor can stack together</li>
            <li>I found myself clicking the back quite often, as I found it to be the most efficient way to return to the home page</li>

          <p>
            I spent the most time dragging around the cupcakes and decor hidden
            on the left side of the home page

          </h2>
          <p>
            My most common interaction on the website was clicking around to see
            if any other surprises were hidden
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="div5">

            interactive experience?
          </h2>
          <p>
            My impression of the interactive experience’s intended goal was to
            surprise me with hidden elements and make me check if there are
            other interactions in the website. Meanwhile content section of the website was made to trick the audience that there was nothing special about this website, while also hinting that there is.

        </div>
        <div id="div6">
          <h2 id="q6">
            How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The website design was very low-key; it was black and white and
            lacked any interesting interaction at a surface level. To hint at a
            surprise interaction, the website laid clues in the articles that the
            designer chose to display. Once the user puts the pieces together
            and finds out the hidden secret, they would be rewarded with a
            surprise interaction.

        <div id="div7">
          <h2 id="q7">
            What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
            with over time?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I believe that the cupcakes and decor is the surprise that the user
            gets after interacting with the website for a while. The user would
            first skim through all of the website’s pages and click on the text
            and images. After taking a closer look, the user would realize that
            there are cupcakes hidden behind doors disguised as grids. After
            finding the surprise, the user would go through everything a second
            time to check if they had missed anything.

        <div id="div8">
          <h2 id="q8">
            How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
            interacted with over time?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted
            with by presenting itself as very low-key, laying out clues that
            hint at something more special. After the special interaction is
            found, the user would want to go through the website a second time
            to see if they have missed anything.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="div9">
          <h2 id="q9">
            What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
            reference?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The experience references other projects, brands, experiences, and
            their website’s personal interactivity. These references are likely the inspiration behind this website; The poster and business card fits this website's thin lined black and white design; The Butter Shower's brand website has a similar layout to Kim's, and hint at the cupcakes; While the "Ways of Reading" websites are studies on human behavior when interacting with websites.

        <div id="div10">

            What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
            act when engaging with your research experience?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The references communicate to me that there is more than meets the
            eye, and hint at me to pay more attention to the details. From reading the references, I try to see if there are any correlation between them and the website.
          </p>

        <div id="div11">
          <h2 id="q11">
            What does this reference communicate to you about how you should
            feel when engaging with your research experience?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I believe that the reference is communicating to me the amount of detail it takes to create an effective simple looking website, as my initial impression of this website was that the
            designer made something uninspiring and amateurish. After I found the hidden interactions and saw the references that show all of the thought that went into this website,
            I felt a little foolish.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The most frustrating part about the interaction are the links that
            take you to another tab. There are links that take you to different
            areas of the website, and others that take you to a different
            website. Both of these links look the same, and I find it annoying
            when I am unknowingly taken to another tab.

          </h2>
          <p>
            I find the most satisfying part of the interaction to be finding the
            cupcakes and finding the correlations between the website and the references. It feels like watching the movie
            for a second time and finding all the hidden details.
