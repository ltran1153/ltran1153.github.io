      <!--This div will appear on over the artpiece at the start. This acts as a warning that this artpiece will contain sound, as well as forcing the user to click the browser at least once.
      I added this here, because I had an issue where the videos and audio won't start playing until I click at least once. So to ensure that no one else had this problem, I added this as a sneaky and project appropriate way to solve the issue-->

I added these because the boxes of the images and videos were too big, therefore these divs are here so the trigger size is more appropriate (for example: the container of the videos took a lot of space, and some of that included the purple background which logically should not trigger an animation)  -->

<!--Reflection:
Reflecting on how I implemented my project, I thought that I found good solutions for the interactivity problems that this project might have. Such as adding a warning screen that forces the user to click at least once, as well as the "#Hover" boxes that act as a more appriate trigger than just the default videos and images.
One thing I did not have foresight over was the way I layed out the elements in html. I thought it was unecessary because I was using position:absolute to layout everything. However, this did not account for responsiveness. In the future, it would be more appropriate to layout my elements properly in html, and using flex-grid + position: relative to move things around-->
