    <h1>Interactive Media 1 Website Review</h1>
    <h2>
      What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
      experience?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The first thing I paid attention to was the underlined headings. I
      believed that pressing them would link me to a different part of the
      website
    </h3>
    <h2>
      Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <li>Scrolling down</li>
      <li>Clicking the text</li>
      <li>Clicking the gifs</li>
      <li>Highlighting the text</li>
      <li>Clicking the grid, which turned out to be doors</li>
      <li>Clicking and dragging the cakes</li>
      <li>Stacking the cakes together</li>
      <li>Clicking the back button often</li>
    </h3>
    <h2>
      What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I spent the most time dragging around the cupcakes and decor hidden on the
      left side of the home page
    </h3>
    <h2>
      What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      My most common interaction on the website was clicking around to see if
      any other surprises were hidden
    </h3>
    <h2>
      What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      My impression of the interactive experience’s intended goal was to
      surprise me with hidden elements and make me check if there are other
      interactions in the website.
    </h3>
    <h2>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>
    <h3>
      The website design was very low-key; it was black and white and lacked any
      interesting interaction at a surface level. To hint at a surprise
      interaction, the website laid clues in the articles the designer chose to
      display. Once the user puts the pieces together and finds out the hidden
      secret, they would be rewarded with a surprise interaction.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I believe that the cupcakes and decor is the surprise that the user gets
      after interacting with the website for a while. The user would first skim
      through all of the website’s pages and click on the text and images. After
      taking a closer look, the user would realize that there are cupcakes
      hidden behind doors disguised as grids. After finding the surprise, the
      user would go through everything a second time to check if they had missed
      anything.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with
      by presenting itself as very low-key, laying out clues that hint at
      something more special. After the special interaction is found, the user
      would want to go through the website a second time to see if they have
      missed anything.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The experience references other projects, brands, experiences, and their
      website’s personal interactivity.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The references communicate to me that there is more than meets the eye,
      and hint at me to pay more attention to the details.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      What does this reference communicate to you about how you should feel when
      engaging with your research experience?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I believe that the reference is communicating to me that I should be more
      humble, as my initial impression of this website was that the designer
      made something uninspiring and amateurish. After I realized I missed
      something about the website, I felt a little foolish.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part frustrating?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The most frustrating part about the interaction are the links that take
      you to another tab. There are links that take you to different areas of
      the website, and others that take you to a different website. Both of
      these links look the same, and I find it annoying when I am unknowingly
      taken to another tab.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part satisfying?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I find the most satisfying part of the interaction to be finding the
      cupcakes and realizing the references in the website were hinting at
      something hidden the whole time. It feels like watching the movie for a
      second time and finding all the hidden details.
